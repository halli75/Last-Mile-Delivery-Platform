Last-Mile Delivery Platform
Project Overview
A comprehensive last-mile delivery platform similar to DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Amazon Fresh, designed to handle the final leg of package delivery from distribution centers to customers.

*Core Microservices Architecture

1. Order Service
Responsibilities:
• Order creation, modification, and cancellation
• Order status management (pending, confirmed, picked up, delivered)
• Order validation and business rule enforcement
• Integration with external e-commerce platforms
Key APIs:
• POST /orders - Create new order
• GET /orders/{orderId} - Get order details
• PUT /orders/{orderId}/status - Update order status
• GET /orders/customer/{customerId} - Get customer order history
Database: PostgreSQL with tables for orders, order_items, order_status_history
3. Customer Service
Responsibilities:
• Customer profile management
• Delivery preferences and addresses
• Customer authentication and authorization
• Loyalty program management
Key APIs:
• POST /customers - Register new customer
• GET /customers/{customerId} - Get customer profile
• PUT /customers/{customerId}/addresses - Manage delivery addresses
• GET /customers/{customerId}/preferences - Get delivery preferences
Database: PostgreSQL with customer profiles, addresses, preferences
4. Driver Service
Responsibilities:
• Driver onboarding and profile management
• Driver availability and shift management
• Performance tracking and ratings
• Driver assignment algorithms
Key APIs:
• POST /drivers - Register new driver
• PUT /drivers/{driverId}/availability - Update availability status
• GET /drivers/available - Get available drivers in area
• GET /drivers/{driverId}/performance - Get driver metrics
Database: PostgreSQL for driver profiles, availability, performance metrics
5. Vehicle Service
Responsibilities:
• Fleet management and vehicle registration
• Vehicle maintenance scheduling
• Vehicle capacity and type management
• Real-time vehicle status tracking
Key APIs:
• POST /vehicles - Register new vehicle
• GET /vehicles/{vehicleId} - Get vehicle details
• PUT /vehicles/{vehicleId}/maintenance - Schedule maintenance
• GET /vehicles/driver/{driverId} - Get driver's assigned vehicles
Database: PostgreSQL for vehicle details, maintenance records, assignments
6. Route Service
Responsibilities:
• Route optimization and planning
• Distance and time estimation
• Traffic-aware routing
• Multi-stop delivery optimization
Key APIs:
• POST /routes/optimize - Generate optimized route
• GET /routes/{routeId} - Get route details
• PUT /routes/{routeId}/update - Update route based on real-time conditions
• GET /routes/estimate - Get delivery time estimate
Database: PostgreSQL for route data, Redis for caching frequent routes
7. GPS Service
Responsibilities:
• Real-time location tracking
• Geofencing and delivery zone management
• Location history and analytics
• ETA calculations
Key APIs:
• POST /gps/location - Update driver location
• GET /gps/driver/{driverId} - Get current driver location
• GET /gps/order/{orderId}/eta - Get estimated delivery time
• POST /gps/geofence - Create delivery zone boundaries
Database: MongoDB for location data, Redis for real-time tracking
8. Delivery Service
Responsibilities:
• Delivery execution and workflow management
• Proof of delivery (photos, signatures)
• Delivery attempt tracking
• Exception handling (failed deliveries)
Key APIs:
• POST /deliveries - Create delivery task
• PUT /deliveries/{deliveryId}/start - Start delivery
• POST /deliveries/{deliveryId}/complete - Mark delivery complete
• POST /deliveries/{deliveryId}/proof - Upload delivery proof
Database: PostgreSQL for delivery records, AWS S3 for proof images
9. Notification Service
Responsibilities:
• Real-time notifications to customers and drivers
• SMS, email, and push notification delivery
• Notification preferences management
• Delivery status updates
Key APIs:
• POST /notifications/send - Send notification
• GET /notifications/customer/{customerId} - Get notification history
• PUT /notifications/preferences - Update notification preferences
• POST /notifications/bulk - Send bulk notifications
Database: PostgreSQL for notification logs, Redis for real-time delivery
10. Analytics Service
Responsibilities:
• Delivery performance metrics
• Customer satisfaction analysis
• Driver performance analytics
• Business intelligence and reporting
Key APIs:
• GET /analytics/delivery-performance - Get delivery KPIs
• GET /analytics/customer-satisfaction - Customer feedback metrics
• GET /analytics/driver-performance - Driver efficiency metrics
• GET /analytics/revenue - Revenue and cost analysis
Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, ClickHouse for analytics
Technical Implementation Details
Inter-Service Communication
• Synchronous: REST APIs with Rest Client for service-to-service calls
• Asynchronous: RabbitMQ for event-driven communication
• Events: Order created, driver assigned, delivery completed, etc.
Database Strategy
• PostgreSQL: Transactional data (orders, customers, drivers)
• MongoDB: Location tracking, logs, flexible schema data
• Redis: Caching, real-time data, session management
• ClickHouse: Analytics and reporting (optional)

Key Events
OrderCreatedEvent → Driver Service, Route Service
DriverAssignedEvent → Customer Service, GPS Service
DeliveryStartedEvent → Customer Service, Analytics Service
DeliveryCompletedEvent → Order Service, Analytics Service
LocationUpdatedEvent → Route Service, Customer Service

Security Implementation
• JWT tokens for authentication
• OAuth2 for third-party integrations
• Role-based access control (Customer, Driver, Admin)
• API rate limiting and throttling
Monitoring & Observability
• Spring Boot Actuator for health checks
• Micrometer + Prometheus for metrics
• Jaeger for distributed tracing

Sample User Scenarios
1. Customer places order → Order Service validates → Driver Service assigns
nearest driver → GPS Service tracks → Notification Service updates customer
2. Driver accepts delivery → Route Service optimizes path → GPS Service provides
navigation → Delivery Service manages execution
3. Delivery completion → Proof uploaded → Customer notified → Analytics Service
updates metrics
